The Amazon Clone project is a web application that replicates the design and layout of the popular online shopping platform, Amazon. Using HTML and CSS, I have meticulously recreated the user interface and visual elements, aiming to provide users with a familiar and seamless shopping experience.

The aim of the Amazon Clone project is to recreate the design and layout of the popular online shopping platform, Amazon, using HTML and CSS. The project's primary objective is to showcase the developer's front-end web development skills by replicating the user interface and visual elements of the original website.

HTML was instrumental in structuring web pages, delineating their architecture, and organizing their content. Utilizing semantic elements and proper document structure allowed for the development of a unified and intuitive user interface.

The clone was styled with CSS to ensure a polished and professional appearance. I incorporated custom CSS styles, including typography, colors, and layouts, to replicate Amazons's visual allure. In addition, CSS enabled responsiveness, allowing the clone to seamlessly conform to varied screen sizes and device types.

In future develops, JavaScript will be incorporated to improve the functionality of the project.
